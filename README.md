CharityStock-Scanner
--------------------

Python script to run the Raspberry Pi end of the Charity Stock project. A USB barcode scanner will trigger a call to the API to record the barcode. 

Rename `user.example.json` to `user.json` and edit the contents so that the correct API URL, username and password are in the blank fields.
